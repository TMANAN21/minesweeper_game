11/25      5 min          Prof.King
           I emailed Prof.King about drawing the cells; I had created the cells on Game.java, but when I ran the program nothing showed up so prof.King suggested that I need to add in canvas. set color and the raisedBevel rectange onto Cell.java and it would work.

           I went to the office hours because my status Box kept giving me error because I didn't know what to put on the first parameter where its type was game, so I tried creating a new object type game but it didn't work. Then, Prof.King mentioned that I should instead use "this" for the first parameter because that is the original games's variable.Then, when I was trying to count the mine the mines weren't showing up and then when I consulted with Prof.King, she suggested I get rid of the my programs class and re-compile again everything and it worked, basically all of my class weren't being updated when I only did Minesweeper.java.

           I asked Prof.King how to draw the neighbormine count and she mentioned to do the canvas.text method,as well if my code was succint regarding incrementing the neighborminecount in Game.java

12/2        10 min      TA  
            I was confused about why my neighborminecount were off the cell and not inside the cell, then the TA suggested that I should use the picture centered method.Then, he also mentioned I can insert a double qutoe beforehand instead of doing another long method to make it possible for canvas.text to take in the neighborminecount as a string.

            I was having problem where my gameWon boolean wasn't working and I had created my own variables to get the remaianing unrevealed cell, but prof.King suggested that there is already a function made in the game.java called getNumCellsRemaining.

12/7        15 min     TA
            I had problem with my neighborminecount where my neighborminecount for some of them were incorrect so I was sort of confused.Then, the TA suggested to get rid of my else statement where I had assigned another random number for row and col so that if the mines did happen to be deployed in the same spot then I would replenish it by doing another random number assigned to the row and col, but TA suggested that I didn't need that.
 
Minesweeper Functionality:
	I have all the basic functionality of the minesweeper game with minecounts, mines and the grid and the status box, timer and the help box.The repaint in cell.java essentially draws the cells, the number of mines their neighbors have, as well as the mines etc.Then the Game.java,creates the various boxes at the bottom of the game, and deploys mines, then counts the neighborminecount and makes it able for people to use their left click on the mouse to reveal the cell and start playing the game. And if they win the game, the game will stop and if they loose the game the game will again stop and reveal all the mines.I have added different colors for odd numbers vs even numbers. And for my mines I have put in a flower to make it a little prettier. Furthemore, I have drawn a square when revealed to show the gridlines ones the cell is revelead. Also, I have removed the 0's to declutter as well.
